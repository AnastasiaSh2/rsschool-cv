#### **About Myself:**  
For the past year, I have delved deep into the topic of web design and have done projects on the look and feel. I am very creative as I have been doing architectural design for a long time. I am inspired by new trends, interesting ideas and beauty around.   

Therefore, I decided to dive deeper into this topic and study the web page from the inside. Seiyaas I am completely immersed in learning Frontend development and I hope that having received all the knowledge gained will help me to be a good Frontend developer.
